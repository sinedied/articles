With the release of [the new SWA CLI](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli), it's never been easier to get started with Azure Static Web Apps! With the new commands you can configure your project to test it locally with the emulator, and deploy it directly from the CLI in a few minutes. It also support multiple configurations, and it's compatible with monorepos. Watch the video to learn how to get started with the new commands.


> If you've never heard of Static Web Apps (or SWA for short), it's a web app hosting service provided by Azure, offering streamlined full-stack development with many built-in features like authentication, customizable routing, serverless functions and more. It also has a great [free tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-yolasors) 😉
