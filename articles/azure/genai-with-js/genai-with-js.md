Generative AI has come a long way in just two years, revolutionizing industries and unlocking new possibilities for developers across the globe. What initially started as a niche field primarily dominated by research and Python-based machine learning has quickly become a mainstream technology that’s reshaping how we approach creativity, automation, and interaction. But what’s even more exciting is how accessible this technology has become for developers from all backgrounds—especially JavaScript developers! 🎉

Today, generative AI isn’t just about building complex models in Python. **The real magic happens when these models are integrated into applications that users interact with every day**, and that’s where JavaScript comes in. As the web’s most widely used programming language, JavaScript plays a pivotal role in how developers build and scale generative AI-powered apps for the browser, mobile, and even server-side environments.

## Introducing Generative AI with JavaScript

We built our new content series, **Generative AI with JavaScript**, to help you harness this power. Whether you’re a web developer curious about AI or an experienced coder looking to leverage generative AI in your projects, this series will walk you through everything you need to know: from connecting to APIs and working with large language models (LLMs), to building sophisticated, AI-driven applications using popular tools like LangChain.js and Azure.

You can access the full series for free on our [YouTube playlist](https://aka.ms/genai-js), where you’ll find videos around 10 minutes long, each focusing on a specific topic:

We've made each video self-contained, so you can watch them in any order that suits your learning style, though we chose and ordered them to provide a smooth learning curve if you're new to generative AI.

## Learn, share & teach

The videos are *only one part* of the learning experience! 😉

We tried to pair each topic with interactive demos, code samples, and additional resources to help you dive deeper into the subject. You can find all these resources in the video descriptions but we also gathered everything in a dedicated GitHub repository: https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-with-javascript

In this repo, you'll find:
- 📚 **Links to all the videos** in the series
- 📄 **Slides and transcripts** for all sessions
- 📦 **Demo and code samples** to get hands-on experience
- 🚀 **Project examples and starter kits** to help you get use Gen AI in your projects
- 🌟 **Additional resources** to learn more about generative AI

We wanted to make sure you have everything you need to learn the concepts, share your knowledge with others, and even teach your own workshops or courses. Feel free to reuse any of the content in your own presentations, blog posts, or videos!

## Want more?

What if I tell you this is just the beginning? 😏

We have plently more content coming, this is just the first part of the series. We have more advanced topics, in-depth tutorials and even more use cases and tools to help you master generative AI with JavaScript. Stay tuned for more updates and new videos!

> If you want to keep the new content coming, don't forget to star the repo, like the videos, subscribe to the channel, yada yada... and share the series with your friends and colleagues! The more we see you're interested, the more we'll be able to create new content for you.

## Tell us your feedback!

We're here to help you learn and grow, so we'd love to hear your feedback on the series. What did you like? What could be improved? What topics would you like to see covered next? Let us know by [opening an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-with-javascript/issues) or by commenting on the videos. We're always listening, and we love to hear back from you! 🙌

You can also join the discussion on the [AI Community #JavaScript channel on Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/1113626258182504448/1237357005555892225) to chat with other developers, ask questions, and share your own projects.

*THANK YOU* for taking this journey with us, I'm excited to see what you'll build!
